## Assignment-2: Design a webpage(HTML) to show QR Code scanner view and up on scanning a QR code, show its embeded information. 

1. Display the weppage with QR Code scanning view(something like PayTM QR Code scanner). No restriction on QR code scanner SDK selection.

2. Take care of requesting camera permission(web cam in case of laptop, built in camera in case of mobile)

3. Up on scanning a valid QR code, just display its embeded information(May be a URL/String description etc).


Further, one can add feature to browse and load QR code image to give above functionality as well.
